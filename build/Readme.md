# SkillValidationPlatform Smart Contract

## Vision

The **SkillValidationPlatform** smart contract enables a decentralized system for issuing and validating skill-based challenges. Users can create challenges, and participants' performance is recorded transparently on-chain, providing an immutable and trustless way to verify skills and achievements.

## Features

- **Issue Challenge**: 
  - Users can create challenges with detailed descriptions, providing opportunities for others to demonstrate their skills.
  
- **Validate Challenge**: 
  - Once a challenge is completed, the issuer can validate the participantâ€™s performance, recording whether the user passed or failed.

## Future Scope

1. **Reputation System**:
   - Implement a reputation system that tracks user performance across multiple challenges.

2. **Automated Validation**:
   - Introduce automated validation using oracles or external systems to verify challenge completion.

3. **Multi-Level Challenges**:
   - Add support for multi-level challenges, where users progress through increasingly difficult stages to validate complex skills.

The **SkillValidationPlatform** contract creates a transparent and verifiable system for skill validation, promoting trust and recognition of accomplishments in a decentralized manner.
